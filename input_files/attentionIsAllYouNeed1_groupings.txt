Attention is all you need.
These five words make up
the title of the scientific paper
that gave birth to
large language models that power
ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and DeepSeek.
5 simple words
Attention is all you need.
And now ChatGPT generates more than
a billion words per day.
This is the story of those five magic words
how they transformed artificial intelligence
with one simple thing:
The ability to pay attention.
I hope to hold your attention
long enough to finish this story.
If I can do that,
I think you’ll come away
with a new appreciation
for attention itself
be it artificial attention,
human attention,
your attention,
mine,
or the kind of
societal attention
that’s being given to
artificial intelligence
as it grows and spreads among us.
And look, if you’re a
human viewer,
I know that your
attention is a precious commodity.
For humans like you,
attention takes time.
It takes energy.
If
Attention is all you need
was just
a story about computers,
I wouldn’t be
bothering to tell it,
and I wouldn’t be
asking you to invest the
time and energy.
I think
Attention is all you need
is about more than computers.
I think that no matter
who you are,
no matter
who you want to be,
no matter
what you want to achieve
in this world
there’s one thing you need,
and only one thing you need.
Attention is all you need.
